# Breath Analysis

This repository contains the code for the [Breath Analysis Project](https://anu365.sharepoint.com/sites/ENGN4221_Breath_Analysis_Capstone_Project) run in 
S2-2019.

The two main modules in this project are an Android App and an Arduino sketch.
The Arduino sketch polls sensors for various data and then hosts the data using 
BLE so that a device can connect to and read from it.
